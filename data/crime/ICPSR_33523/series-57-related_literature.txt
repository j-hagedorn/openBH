This report was prepared using actual data supplied by law enforcement
agencies to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program under its [then] new
National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Its purpose is to
demonstrate a potential utility of the NIBRS data,
and its content should not be viewed as a reliable indicator of the family
violence experience. The [then] current volume of data in the NIBRS is too
small to produce any reliable national statements on this topic. This
report, however, is an example of the national analysis that will be
possible as the database grows.

Summarizes and analyzes national and state juvenile arrest data presented
in the FBI report Crime in the United States 2004. As the Bulletin reports,
the juvenile violent crime arrest rate in 2004 reached its lowest level
since 1980. The rate, which grew substantially during the late 1980s and
peaked in 1994, has decreased for 10 consecutive years. In 2004, it was
half its 1994 peak level. The juvenile arrest rate for each of the offenses
tracked in the FBI's Violent Crime Index (murder, forcible rape, robbery,
and aggravated assault) has been declining steadily since the mid-1990s;
for murder, the rate fell 77% from its 1993 peak through 2004.
